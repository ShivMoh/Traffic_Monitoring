These points were marked and used as anchor points to calculate the movement of the vehicles and translate it into estimated real world coordinates.","As shown in the image above, the coordinates divide the shape into four main quadrants. Depending on the quadrant that the vehicle is in, the sign for the operation to calculate the real world coordinate will change (negative or positive).","The process overall is straight foward. Suppose the vehicle is currentl in Q1, at location (x_i, y_i). We can use the reference point A, call it (x_a, y_b), and its known translation to lat and lng, call it (lat_a, lat_b), with a following reference point B, to calculate a x and y ratio using the following equation:","In code, this was expressed as:","This ratio is then multiplied by the current in frame coordinates to achieve the location in the map. In code this, was done as follows:"]},{"l":"Code Structure","p":["The overall code application is divided into server-client structure.
